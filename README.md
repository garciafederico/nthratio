# NTHRATIO and RNTHCOMP, by Federico Garc√≠a

RNTHCOMP is NTHCOMP XSPEC model, where the normalization is changed
using a parameter that determines at which energy the model is unity
for a unity norm.

NTHRATIO is a multiplicative XSPEC model based on RNTHCOMP, used to
first-order correct the soft-excess introduced by xillver-based models.
